# POLLENE 
A combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Bootswatch. This is a simple function of a poll.

## Experience
It was such a challenge. We first planned everything on blueprint. We first decided how the user interface flowed. Second, we've listed the functionalities we're going to need and the codes we might not know. Third is deligating tasks and choosing which of the codes we'll be in charge of, who will look for the layout and color, who will compile the code's we've looked up, etc. It was a fun experience to work and code with different people with different duties. The best part is everyone did our share, as much as we could.

## Problems
We've had a hard time creating an array of objects and actually getting the names just by using student numbers. We've tried studying cookies and local storage but time was limited so we've ended up with using arrays and conditional statements.

## To Dos
We'll continue studying local storage. We'll have an option to sign up new and remove old students.
